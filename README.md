### SWAPIFY - A SPOTIFY CLONE USING JAVA AND SPRING FRAMEWORK
### BRIEF DESCRIPTION
This project is a rough clone of the popular music app Spotify. This forum is dedicated entirely for ease of navigation for music fans. The Swapify App will accept user sign up data and populate specific tables with user information. The goal was to utilize the benefits of dependencies and SQL databases to store information about our users our data. Our users are our listeners and artists, and the data would be the song information and user information.
### IMAGES
### TECHNOLOGIES USED

Spring Framework(Spring Boot, Spring Data, and Spring Security, and Spring Testing)

IntelliJ IDEA

PostgreSQL

The langauges used are Java and SQL.

## APPROACH TAKEN
Our approach began from utilizing Spring technology. Mapping out the purpose each of the aspects of the Spring Framework helped me to understand how to progress with each of the steps. From there, we had to implement each of these aspects accordingly. We rebuilt the project four times because we didn’t know how to troubleshoot Spring Framework technology in the IntelliJ environment. We also didn’t think to add the repo to a Git flow because we didn’t grasp the concept of VCS (Version Control System). While we was understanding how to implement the Spring Framework, we was creating more problems because we wasn’t approaching the project in planned stages.
10-1
## HOW TO USE
The user uses the App
## UNSOLVED PROBLEMS
## HURDLES
Trying to get the database to work because it was giving us a hard time.
