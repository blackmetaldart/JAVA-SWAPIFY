### SWAPIFY - A SPOTIFY CLONE USING JAVA AND SPRING FRAMEWORK

### DESCRIPTION
This project is a rough clone of the popular music app Spotify. This forum is dedicated entirely for ease of navigation for music fans. The Swapify App will accept user sign up data and populate specific tables with user information. The goal was to utilize the benefits of dependencies and SQL databases to store information about our users our data. Our users are our listeners and artists, and the data would be the song information and user information.

### TECHNOLOGIES USED
[INTELLIJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) - The IDE used
[POSTGRESQL](https://www.postgresql.org) The object-relational database system used
[MAVEN](https://maven.apache.org/) - Dependency Management 

## APPROACH TAKEN
Our approach began with utilizing Spring technology. We mapped out the goals for the application. This helped us understand how to progress through the development of the application. Afterwards, we had to implement the functionality in stages. We mapped out all of the endpoints, their purpose, and the privileges needed to access them. We rebuilt the project four times because we didnt know how to troubleshoot Spring Framework technology in the IntelliJ environment. We also didn’t think to add the repo to a Git flow because we didn’t grasp the concept of VCS (Version Control System).

## UNSOLVED PROBLEMS
We're still unsure of how to completely connect full-stack applications. There is a font-end that has the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is a background that uses Java and database functionality.

## HURDLES
We struggled to create the tables with the application in the early stages of development. We also struggled to translate the SQL in the IntelliJ environment.
