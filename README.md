### SWAPIFY - A SPOTIFY CLONE USING JAVA AND SPRING FRAMEWORK

### BRIEF DESCRIPTION
This project is a rough clone of the popular music app Spotify. This forum is dedicated entirely for ease of navigation for music fans. The Swapify App will accept user sign up data and populate specific tables with user information. The goal was to utilize the benefits of dependencies and SQL databases to store information about our users our data. Our users are our listeners and artists, and the data would be the song information and user information.

### TECHNOLOGIES USED
This project was initialized on the Spring Frameworks Initializer. We wrote in the Java language and used the IntelliJ IDEA. We used Postgres to manipulate our databases and Maven dependencies to add additional functionality to our site. We

## APPROACH TAKEN
Our approach began with utilizing Spring technology. We mapped out the goals for all of the application. This helped us understand how to progress through the development of the application. Afterwards, we had to implement the functionality in stages. We rebuilt the project four times because we didnt know how to troubleshoot Spring Framework technology in the IntelliJ environment. We also didn’t think to add the repo to a Git flow because we didn’t grasp the concept of VCS (Version Control System).

## HOW TO USE

## UNSOLVED PROBLEMS

## HURDLES
We struggled to create the tables with the application in the early stages of development. We also struggled to translate the SQL in the IntelliJ environment.
